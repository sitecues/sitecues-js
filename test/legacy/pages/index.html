<h1>Site Test Pages</h1>
<p>This location is reserved for "Test" pages that can be viewed in the browser as a web-page or called by the Unit Test framework. For example, these test pages range from: small tests and examples of individual pieces of functionality like "how Mouse Cursors behave across different browsers", to site layouts like "eBank", that we can test sitecuesâ„¢ against as we develop.</p>
