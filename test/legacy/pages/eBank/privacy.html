<h2>Our Online Security Commitment</h2>
<p>eBank is committed to providing you with a secure online experience that protects your confidential information. Our employees are trained on our security policies and procedures and work diligently to protect the integrity of your information.</p>
<p>We use industry-accepted security practices, including firewalls and encryption, to safeguard the security of your personal financial information. These controls allow us to properly authenticate your identity when you access our online services and help to protect your information as it travels over the Internet between your computer and eBank. We also constantly monitor and assess the security of our systems.</p>
<p>With everything we're doing to protect your information, keep in mind that it is also important for you to take precautions to safeguard personal information on your end.</p>
<h4>Secure Login</h4>
<p>eBank employs a layered security approach to help protect your accounts and your identity. When you set up your account, you will be asked to provide personal security questions and answers to help authenticate your user ID and password. In addition, our security system will recognize your user patterns (when and how you access the online banking site) and use this information to verify your identity. Also, if you sign on to eBank Online Banking from a device that we do not recognize we will ask you to answer a Security Question for which only you know the answer. Lastly, we may also ask you one of your Security Questions periodically as yet an additional layer of security.</p>
<p>You should never give out your user name and password and security question answers to anyone, and eBank will never ask for this information from you via e-mail, phone, or a store. You should also make your password difficult to guess and using a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.</p>
<h4>Automated Time Out</h4>
<p>To provide additional protection, a time out feature is used on selected portions of our website. This feature will automatically log you off of your current online session after a period of inactivity. Re-establishing and authenticating your credentials for your online session helps to reduce unauthorized access to your accounts.</p>
<h4>Use of Firewalls</h4>
<p>To protect data stored on our systems and to prevent unauthorized access, we employ firewalls where appropriate. Firewalls are software and hardware products that are intended to define, control and limit the access to a website, network or computer system. We also use Intrusion Detection Systems to detect and identify potential intruders.</p>
<h4>Third Party Verification</h4>
<p>eBank works with independent third-party security firms to perform security reviews of our online services and systems. Systems are monitored and updated as needed to protect against known security risks. In addition to the third-party testing, our internal security personnel use several risk assessment and security tools to monitor and maintain the security of our online systems.</p>
<p>In addition to these measures, this website is also registered with Verisign, an industry leader in website identification and encryption. Via your browser, Verisign allows you to confirm this website provider's identity before transmitting any personal information.</p>
<h4>Encryption</h4>
<p>Most web browsers have the ability to communicate securely with a website by encrypting the information as it passes across the Internet. This method of communication is called Secure Socket Layer (SSL). eBank requires the use of a browser which supports 128-bit SSL encryption to log in to the online banking website. If you see a website address that begins with "https" (as opposed to "http") and the "closed padlock" () in the lower right hand corner of your browser, you are using an SSL connection to transfer your confidential information.</p>
<h4>Secure Messaging and E-Mail</h4>
<p>Many of our online services have a secure messaging feature. In order to access secure messaging, you must log in with your user name and password. Messages sent within our online banking system are secure. You may also contact us by phone, postal mail or in person.</p>
<p><small>Note: Regular Internet e-mail is not secure, so please do not send confidential information such as Social Security or account numbers to us via regular e-mail.</small></p>
<h3>Security is Everyone's Responsibility</h3>
<p>We take the safeguarding of your information seriously. In fact, we believe keeping your information safe and secure is every employee's responsibility. However, even the best security measures can only prevent fraud if you are also vigilant about employing the necessary safeguards to protect your information.</p>
